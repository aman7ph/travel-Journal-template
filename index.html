              Harar is a city in eastern Ethiopia. It’s surrounded by a
              centuries-old defensive wall that has several large gates,
              including Duke's Gate. The city is known for its mazelike alleys
              and traditional houses decorated inside with flat hanging baskets.
              A replica house features at the Harar Community Centre Museum. A
              holy Islamic city, Harar has many mosques, including the Grand
              Jami Mosque with its tall white minarets.
